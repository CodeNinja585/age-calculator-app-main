## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to create an Age Calculator App that allows users to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted.
  - The day number is not between 1-31.
  - The month number is not between 1-12.
  - The year is in the future.
  - The date is invalid (e.g., 31/04/1991, as there are 30 days in April).
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted.
